# Classifying Cats Vs Dogs With 96% Accuracy

The classification of cats and dogs has been a long standing deep learning challenge facilitated by Kaggle. This notebook explores the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), data augmentation, 
and other regularization techniques as they relate to this binary classification problem. This is achieved without the use of transfer learning or pretrained models.
